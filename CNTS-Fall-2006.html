      <h1>Collaborative Number Theory Seminar</h1>
    </center>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>The aim of this seminar is to cover material not normally covered
      in graduate courses and related to Analytic Number Theory and
      Automorphic Forms. It should be accessible to graduate students
      that have successfully completed the basic graduate courses in
      Real Analysis, Complex Analysis and Algebra. </p>
    <p> This semester the seminar meets on Fridays at 4:00 PM in Room
      4214-03 (Mathematics Thesis Room). Among other speakers, this
      semester the following people have agreed to give a talk: Alina
      Bocur (IAS), Wenzhi Luo (Ohio State and IAS). </p>

          Title: Basic properties of hyperbolic and elliptic Eisenstein
          series
        </p>
        <p>
          Abstract: We will define hyperbolic and elliptic Eisenstein
          series on general finite volume hyperbolic Riemann surfaces,
          after which we will discuss results regarding fundamental
          questions regarding these series, including: Meromorphic
          continuation, location of
          poles, and Kronecker limit problem. As time permits, we will
          show that both hyperbolic and elliptic Eisenstein series limit
          to
          parabolic Eisenstein series through degeneration. </p>

      <li><b> October 20, Steven J. Miller (Brown Univ.)</b>
        <p>Title: Identifying and breaking the symmetry group of zeros
          of families of L-functions
        </p>
        <p>
          Abstract: Many studies have shown that the zeros near the
          central point of families of L-functions are well modeled by
          eigenvalues near one of a classical compact group. While the
          monodromy group in the function field case suggests what that
          group should be, determining the group in the number field
          case is often a matter of calculation (and sometimes the
          results seem surprising at first). We show, at least for
          families built from nice GL(2) L-functions, that the symmetry
          can be determined by the second moment of the Satake
          parameters, and behaves nicely under convolution. The
          universality is similar to that found by Rudnick and Sarnak
          for the high zeros. We conclude by studying one-parameter
          families of elliptic curves over Q, where we break this
          universality by finding lower order correction terms which
          depend on the arithmetic of the family.TBA</p>

        <p>An integral characterizing the Andreotti-Mayer locus.
        </p>
        <p>
          Abstract:
          Let A_n denote the moduli space of n-dimensional, principally
          polarized,
          abelian varieties and p:A-&gt;A_n the corresponding universal
          abelian
          variety with universal theta divisor Theta_A. The
          Andreotti-Mayer locus
          N_0 is then defined as the set of all points q in A such
          that the fiber Theta_q of Theta is singular. D. Mumford showed
          that
          N_0=div(F_n),
          where F_n is a Siegel modular form
          of weight k=n!(n+3)/2 (and some character) for the full Siegel
          modular group
          Sp_n(Z).
          Mumford raised the question, if there is an explicit
          polynomial in the theta constants,
          or other modular forms constructed from theta series (with
          quadratic forms and pluri-
          harmonic coefficients) whose zeros give N_0 with suitable
          multiplicities.
          An explicit representation of Mumford's modular form F_n is
          known
          for n
          &lt;=4. In our talk we will report on joint work with R.
          Salvati Manni, in which we give
          an integral representation of Mumford's modular form F_n.
