      <p>Title: Fourier coefficients of Maass forms at various cusps</p>
      <p>Abstract: Let f be a newform (Maass form) of level N with a
        primitive character modulo N. We find the relation between the
        Fourier coefficients of f at infinity and other cusps using a
        corresponding automorphic form on the adele group. </p>

      <p>Title: Asymptotics for special derivatives of quadratic
        L-series
      </p>
      <p>Abstract: We shall explain a proof of a quantitative
        nonvanishing result conjectured by Ph.Michel and A.Venkatesh
        which concerns the special derivatives occuring in the
        Gross-Zagier formula. A geometric consequence concerns the rank
        of rational elliptic curves over Hilbert class fields of
        imaginary quadratic fields. Then we shall try to summarize in
        more details what can be said about the height of Heegner points
        when the discriminant gets large. Both analytic and geometric
        methods are relevant in this context.

      <p>Title: Abelian surfaces of odd conductor: existence,
        non-existence and modularity</p>
      <p>Abstract: The modularity conjecture for two-dimensional abelian
        varieties A over the rationals would associate to the isogeny
        class of A a Siegel modular form of weight 2 and specified
        level. I will discuss joint work with Armand Brumer to test this
        conjecture. We prove non-existence of certain classes of abelian
        surfaces by a careful study of their division fields. We also
        construct abelian surfaces, including some that are not
        principally polarized. Examples will be given. Our results are
        compatible with work in progress of Chris Poor and David Yuen on
        Siegel forms.</p>

      <p>Title: Relative trace formulae with a view towards unitary
        groups</p>
      <p>Abstract: Shimura varieties are a class of quasi-projective
        varieties equipped
        with rich symmetries due to the action of a large set of
        correspondences controlled by a reductive group. The study of
        algebraic cycles on such varieties is of deep arithmetic and
        geometric
        interest. In this talk we will explain how the twisted relative
        trace
        formula can used to study certain families of cycles on Shimura
        varieties attached to unitary groups.</p>

      <p>Title: Statistics of the zeros of zeta functions in ensembles
        of hyperelliptic curves over a finite field </p>
      <p>Abstract: Much of the Diophantine information concerning curves
        over a finite field is encoded in the zeta function of the
        curve. We investigate the statistics of such zeta functions as
        the curve varies in a moduli space of hyperelliptic curves over
        a finite field. When the genus g is fixed and the finite field
        grows, Katz and Sarnak showed that the statistics are those of
        random unitary symplectic 2g by 2g matrices. I will discuss what
        is known for the opposite limit, when the finite field is fixed
        and the genus grows. </p>

      <p>Title: Toroidal automorphic forms and the Riemann hypothesis
        for some
        function fields of curves</p>
      <p><b>Special time and room: 4pm-5pm in Room 6417.</b> This will
        be a joint talk with the <a href="http://websupport1.citytech.cuny.edu/faculty/lghezzi/seminar.html">

      <p>Abstract: In the 1970's, Don Zagier introduced toroidal
        automorphic
        forms to study the zeros of zeta functions. An automorphic form
        on
        GL(2) is toroidal if all its right translates integrate to zero
        over
        all nonsplit tori in GL(2). In the upper half plane, this
        corresponds
        to summing over CM-points (for negative discriminant), or
        integrating
        along geodesics (for positive discriminant).
        The link with zeta functions is provided by a result of Hecke:
        an
        Eisenstein series is toroidal if its weight is a zero of the
        zeta
        function of the corresponding field.<br>
        We consider this theory for function fields of certain curves
        over
        finite fields. The toroidal integrals corresponds to sums over
        certain
        vector bundles on the curve.<br>
        <br>
        We compute the space of toroidal automorphic forms for the
        function
        field of three elliptic curves over finite fields. The method is
        elementary: we reduce the vanishing of toroidal integrals to an
        infinite system of linear equations on some graph. For this, one
        has
        to understand the moduli of certain vector bundles on the
        elliptic
        curve. <br>
        <br>
        We deduce an "automorphic'' proof for the Riemann hypothesis for
        the
        zeta function of those curves.

      <p>Title: Modular forms and elliptic curves over Q(zeta_5)</p>
      <p>There have been many computational investigations into
        modularity of
        elliptic curves over number fields other than Q, especially for
        imaginary quadratic fields (Cremona and his students,
        Dieulefait--Guerberoff--Pacetti) and real quadratic fields
        (Dembele).
        In this talk we present work in progress with F. Hajir,
        D. Ramakrishnan, and D. Yasaki that treats the totally complex
        quartic
        field of fifth roots of unity. We will discuss our computational
        techniques and will give examples of elliptic curves over this
        field
        whose L-series apparently match those given by the Hecke data of
        eigenforms.
