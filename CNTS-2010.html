                <p>Title: Higher congruences between modular forms.<br>
                  <br>
                  Abstract: Given a prime number p and two modular forms
                  on a congruence
                  subgroup that have coefficients in the ring of
                  integers of some number field
                  K, we will discuss the problem of deciding whether
                  these forms have
                  coefficients that are congruent mod P^m (where P is a
                  fixed prime ideal of K
                  over p and m is a positive integer). The main focus
                  will be on eigenforms on Gamma_1(N), and determining
                  necessary
                  and sufficient computable criteria for two such forms
                  to be congruent mod P^m
                  (possibly outside the prime divisors of Np). One of
                  the primary applications
                  of determining such criteria is the ability to
                  determine if the associated mod
                  P^m Galois representations are isomorphic. Using these
                  computable criteria, we have systematically computed a
                  wealth of
                  examples of such higher congruences, and based on
                  these examples we discuss
                  conjectures on maximal congruences between newforms on
                  Gamma_0(N). This is based on joint work with I. Chen
                  and I. Kiming.

                <p>Title: Toroidal automorphic forms.<br>
                  <br>
                  Abstract: A formula of Erich Hecke in an article from
                  1917 laid a connection between a sum of values of an
                  Eisenstein series E(-,s) with the value zeta(s) of the
                  zeta function. We call an automorphic form toroidal if
                  the corresponding sum (or integral in its adelic
                  formulation) vanishes for all right translates. The
                  importance of this definition lies in a reformulation
                  of the Riemann hypothesis in terms of the space of
                  toroidal automorphic forms as observed by Don Zagier.
                  Namely, the Eisenstein series E(-,s) lies in a
                  tempered representation if and only if s has real part
                  1/2, and by Hecke's formula, E(-,s) is toroidal if s
                  is a zero of the zeta functions. In order to reverse
                  the latter statement, non-vanishing results has to be
                  shown for the factors occuring in Hecke's formula. In
                  a joint work with Gunther Cornelissen, double
                  Dirichlet series are used for this purpose. In this
                  talk, we will introduce into the theory of toroidal
                  automorphic
                  forms and give an overview of results in this
                  direction. Then we will explain how to use double
                  Dirichlet series to show non-vanishing results.

                  semi-stability.<br>
                  <br>
                  Abstract: The minimal discriminant is a divisor that
                  has support at the points of bad reduction of
                  an elliptic curve over a function field or number
                  field. Szpiro's Theorem bounds the degree
                  of the minimal discriminant divisor of an elliptic
                  curve over a function field in terms of the
                  genus of the function field and the number of points
                  of bad reduction. The corresponding
                  statement for number fields is equivalent to one
                  formulation of the ABC-conjecture.
                  For self-maps of the projective line over a function
                  field, there is an analogous concept
                  of bad reduction. One can construct a divisor which
                  measures this: the minimal resultant.
                  We construct a condition for measuring the minimality
                  (at a point on the given curve)
                  of a given presentation of a dynamical system, and use
                  this to show a counterexample
                  to the natural dynamical analogue to Szpiro's Theorem
                  in this context. We also show
                  that a semi-stable presentation of a dynamical system
                  over a function field realizes the
                  conductor (the set of points of bad reduction). This
                  is joint work with Lucien Szpiro and Michael Tepper.

                  the conjecture by Bhargava, Shankar and Tsimerman, and
                  uses the Shintani zeta functions. With the twists of
                  the Shintani zeta function by Dirichlet characters, we

                  Abstract: The Fourier coefficients of modular forms
                  are well-known to contain useful arithmetic
                  information. These Fourier coefficients may be thought

                  half plane, building on earlier work of Rodriguez

                  Abstract: Proving that ``nice'' Galois representations
                  arise from automorphic forms has been a major theme in
                  number theory for well over a decade. We will discuss
                  an approach based on studying the ideal of
                  reducibility of a universal deformation that allows us
                  to prove new cases of modularity. Examples include
                  some 2-dimensional Galois representations over
                  imaginary quadratic fields (unconditional) and
                  4-dimensional Galois representations over the

                  prime p does not divide the order of G, then p is
                  unramified in the field of moduli of the G-cover.
                  Wewers generalized this: if p exactly divides the
                  order of G, then p is tamely ramified in the field of
                  moduli. We will discuss extensions of this result,

                  <br>
                  Abstract: Values of Dirichlet L-functions at positive
                  integers are expressible in terms of powers of pi and
                  values of polylogarithms at algebraic numbers. In this
                  talk we will focus on finding analogies of these
                  results over function fields of positive
                  characteristic. In particular, we will consider
                  special values of Goss L-functions for Dirichlet
                  characters, which take values in the completion of the
                  rational function field in one variable over a finite
                  field. Building on work of Anderson for the case of
                  L(1,chi), we deduce various power series identities on
                  tensor powers of the Carlitz module that are
                  "log-algebraic" and in turn use these formulas to
                  determine exact values of L(n,chi) for arbitrary n
                  &gt; 0. Moreover, we relate these L-series values to
                  powers of the Carlitz period and values of Carlitz
                  polylogarithms at algebraic points.</p>

                  Abstract: For a hyperbolic surface embedded
                  eigenvalues are unstable and tend to become
                  resonances. The sufficient dissolving condition was
                  identified by Phillips-Sarnak and is elegantly
                  expressed in Fermi's Golden Rule. We prove formulas
                  for higher approximations and obtain necessary and
                  sufficient conditions for dissolving a cusp form into
                  a resonance. We relate the result to the special

                  it has potential good reduction at all places v of K.
                  The first proof uses algebraic geometry and geometric
