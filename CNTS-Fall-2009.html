      <p>Title: On the non-vanishing problem of theta lifts</p>
      <p>Abstract: In this talk, after giving fairly self-contained
        backgrounds <br>
        on theta lifting, we will discuss some recent results on
        non-vanishing <br>
        of global theta lifts. This is partly a joint work with Wee Teck
        Gan.<br>

    <li><b> November 6, Anthony Weaver (Bronx Community College, CUNY)</b>
      <p>Title: A Diophantine Frobenius Problem: the Largest Non-Genus
        of a Cyclic Group</p>
      <p>Abstract: We obtain sharp upper and lower bounds on a certain <br>
        four-dimensional Frobenius number determined by a prime pair
        (p,q), <br>
        including exact formulae for two infinite subclasses of such
        pairs. <br>
        The problem is motivated by the study of compact (Riemann)
        surfaces <br>
        which are regular pq-fold coverings of surfaces of lower genus.
        In <br>
        this context, the Frobenius number is (up to an additive
        translation) the <br>
        largest genus in which no surface is such a covering. The
        general n-dimesnional <br>
        Frobenius problem ($n \geq 3$) is NP-hard, and it is not clear
        whether <br>
        our restricted problem retains this property. Our methods are
        elementary: <br>
        only some linear algebra, the division algorithm, and
        inequalities. <br>
        This is joint work with Cormac O' Sullivan.

    <li><b> November 13, ChongGyu Lee (Brown University)</b>
      <p>Title: D-ratio and its applications</p>
      <p>Abstract: When f: P^n -&gt; P^n be a morphism of degree d, then
        we have following inequality:<br>
        1/d h( f(P) ) - C_1 &lt; h( P ) &lt; 1/d h ( f(P) ) + C_2. <br>
        If f: P^n -&gt; P^n is a rational map, then the second
        inequality <br>
        h( P ) &lt; 1/d h ( f(P) ) + C_2 <br>
        is invalid because of the failure of the functorial property of
        Weil Height <br>
        Machine. However, by defining new invariant of rational map
        which is called <br>
        D-ratio, we can get similar inequality: <br>
        1/d h( f(P) ) - C_1 &lt; h( P ) &lt; r(f) /d h ( f(P) ) + C_2 <br>
        where r(f) is the D-ratio of f. This inequality will give us
        some applications <br>
        in Arithmetic Dynamics - the height boundedness of preperiodic
        points of a rational map f. <br>
        In addition, D-ratio can provides another applications - proof
        of Kawaguchi's <br>
        Conjecture, improvement of Silverman's result for jointly
        regular pair of rational maps, etc.

      <p>Title: Specializations of elliptic surfaces, and divisibility
        in the
        Mordell-Weil group</p>
      <p>Abstract: Let E be an elliptic surface over a curve C, defined
        over a<br>
        number field K. A reasonable question to ask is "To what extent
        does<br>
        the geometry of the fibration dictate the arithmetic of the
        fibres?"<br>
        Specializing at a fibre gives a homomorphism from the group of<br>
        sections E(C) of E to the Mordell-Weil group E_t(K) of the
        fibre. I<br>
        will discuss the properties of this specialization, with an
        emphasis<br>
        on the size of the torsion subgroup of E_t(K) modulo the image
        of<br>
        E(C), which one might think of as a measure of surjectivity of
        the<br>
        specialization that takes ignores differences in rank.<br>

      <b> December 4, Sonal Jain (NYU)</b>
      <p>Title: On the minimum canonical height for an elliptic curve
        over <b>C</b>(t)</p>
      <p>Lang's height conjecture postulates a uniform lower bound for
        the<br>
        canonical height of a nontorsion point on an elliptic curve.
        Hindry and<br>
        Silverman proved Lang's height conjecture under the hypothesis
        of a<br>
        conjecture of Lucien Szpiro. Szpiro's conjecture is equivalent
        to the ABC<br>
        conjecture, which is known over function fields. It is natural
        to ask: <br>
        What is the smallest possible canonical height of a nontorsion
        point<br>
        on an elliptic curve over a function field $K$? We find new
        record<br>
        for the canonical height of a nontorsion point on an elliptic
        curve over <br>
        <b>C</b>(t), and give heuristics suggesting this is the minimum
        possible.
