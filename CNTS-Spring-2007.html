        <p> Title: Some Recent Instances and Applications of
          Functoriality
        </p>
        <p>
          Abstract: In these talks we discuss a number of recent results
          in number
          theory and group representations which are all consequences of
          certain
          cases of Langlands functoriality conjecture. Among the
          application we
          mention upper bounds for sums of Kloosterman sums over an
          arithmetic progression
          (communications with Sarnak), holomorphy of the spin
          L-function for GSp(4)
          (joint with Asgari), existence of Siegel modular froms of
          weight 3 and higher
          and genus 2 which are neither of Saito-Kurokawa nor Yoshida
          types (joint
          with Ramakrishnan), orthogonal and symplectic representations
          of GL(n) and
          reducibility questions for classical groups (joint with
          Cogdell, Kim and
          Piatetski-Shapiro), as well as a brief mention of the work of
          Khare-Larsen-Savin on the inverse Galois problem. One of the
          main
          ingredients in most of these results is the functorial
          transfer
          of generic cuspidal representations of classical groups to
          GL(n) which
          we will discuss here in more generality now that the main
          obstacle in
          establishing them, i.e., stability of root numbers, is
          resolved for
          quasisplit classical groups in a joint paper with Cogdell and
          Piatetski-Shapiro. </p>
        <p> Professor Shahidi will give two talks: 1:00-2:00 PM and
          3:30-5:00 PM in Room 4419</p>

        <p>Title: Tame Supercuspidal Representations
        </p>
        <p>
          Supercuspidal representations are the basic building blocks in
          the representation theory of reductive groups over p-adic
          fields. Relatively recently, J.-K. Yu established a general
          construction that associates supercuspidal representations to
          certain parametrizing data. This talk discusses the problem of
          determining when two different parameters yield equivalent
          representations. This is an unexpected consequence of general
          results involving symmetric spaces over p-adic fields obtained
          jointly with Fiona Murnaghan. </p>

        <p> Title: Isospectral tori and automorphic forms: An
          introduction</p>
        <p>When do the vectors in two lattices in R^n have same lengths,
          while the lattices are not the same? The first examples of
          Witt (n=16) give also the first examples of isospectral tori
          (Milnor) and were the first examples of isospectral manifolds.
          There is a complete theory in which dimensions the phenomena
          happens. Quite often we can prove that the lengths are the
          same by creating a theta series, which is a modular form and
          look at the dimension of the appropriate space of modular
          forms. </p>

        <p> Title:
          A Sieve Method for Quantum Unique Ergodicity
        </p>
        <p>
          We'll look at the problem of Quantum Unique Ergodicity on the
          classical quotient space SL(2,Z)\H by reducing to the study of
          shifted sums of Hecke eigenvalues of Maass cusp forms. We'll
          then analyze the average size of the shifted summation terms
          by means of an upper-bound sieve and obtain a non-trivial
          result which suggests cancellation among the terms may not be
          required for the proof of Quantum Unique Ergodicity.
          Generalizations can then be made for any shifted sum of
          multiplicative functions, including sums with multiple shifts.

        <p> Title: "Newforms for SL(2) and U(1,1)."
        </p>
        <p>
          Abstract:
          The theory of newforms, originally developed by Atkin and
          Lehner in the
          classical context of cusp forms on the upper half-plane, was
          reinterpreted
          in terms of the representation theory of GL(2) by Casselman.
          The theory
          was later
          extended to GL(n) by Jacquet, Piatetski-Shapiro, and Shalika.
          The
          significance of newforms to the theory of automorphic forms
          will be
          discussed in this setting. We will then present some recent
          extensions of
          this
          theory to SL(2) and the quasi-split unramified unitary group
          U(1,1). </p>

        <p> Title: Undecidable problems about rational points and
          conjectures about elliptic curves
        </p>
        <p>
          Abstract. This talk is about joint work with Karim Zahidi
          (Antwerp/Ghent), in which we describe a conjecture about
          elliptic curves (existence of primitive divisors that are
          inert in a quadratic field) that implies the existence of an
          easy undecidable problem about rational points on varieties.
          After a short historical introduction to undecidability, I
          will provide some heuristics for the conjecture, and prove a
          weaker-in-density version.</p>

          NOTE CHANGE OF TIME: 4:00 PM</b>
        <p> Title: A p-adic construction of global points on elliptic
          curves over imaginary
          quadratic field
        </p>
        <p>
          Abstract: An elliptic curve E over an imaginary quadratic
          field F is in
          most cases conjectured to correspond to a weight 2 cusp form
          on GL_2(A_F)
          (a la Shimura-Taniyama). Such forms admit an elementary
          description as
          harmonic differentials on quotients of the upper half-space,
          and are the
          only type of modular form other than on GL_2(Q) to posess an
          analogous,
          1-dimensional modular symbol. Using this modular symbol we
          construct
          certain measures on P^1(C_p), p a characteristic of bad
          reduction, and
          define period integrals whose image under the Tate
          parametrization
          conjecturally yields points defined over class fields of a
          suitable
          quadratic extension K/F, thus giving an answer to Hilbert's
          12th problem
          for some totally complex quartic fields K. The talk will have
          two parts:
          1. We will present the numerical evidence for this
          construction,
          2. In the case where E is defined over Q, we prove that the
          period of the
          corresponding modular form over F is, up to an explicit
          constant, a
          rational multiple of the area of E(C). </p>

        <p> Title: Automorphic forms and the cohomology of arithmetic
          groups
        </p>
        <p>
          The cohomology of arithmetic groups provides a concrete
          realization of
          certain kinds of automorphic forms, and thus provides one
          approach to
          explicitly study them. In this talk we explain this connection
          and
          describe some techniques to study these cohomology spaces. Our
          goal
          is to show in some cases how to compute the action of the
          Hecke
          operators on the "interesting" part of the cohomology, namely
          the part
          that contains the contributions of the cusp forms. </p>

        <p> Title: Deformations of Maass forms
        </p>
        <p>Abstract: The Laplacian on a non-compact surface does not,
          in general, have a discrete spectrum. An exception is the
          arithmetic surfaces which arise in number theory. I will
          discuss the behavior of the discrete spectrum in response
          to deformations an arithmetic surface, in particular
          numerical experiments and their relation to theoretical
          results.</p>

      <li><b> April 27, Marc McKee (Purdue University)</b>
        <p>Title: Whittaker functions, Eisenstein series, and finite
          order</p>
        <p> Recently, it has been shown that Eisenstein series attached
          to smooth sections (as opposed to K-finite) are meromorphic.
          However, very easy examples have been given that show that
          other analytic properties (specifically, meromorphy of finite
          order) do not hold as in the K-finite case. This parallels the
          same situation for Whittaker functions. Some ideas within this
          framework have had applications in the automorphic context. In
          this talk, I will sketch some proofs of these results and
          constructions. I will first give a chronological motivation
          for looking at these problems, and will end with a related
          interesting open question.</p>

        <p> Title: Unitary periods and the Jacquet's relative trace
          formula
        </p>
        <p>
          Abstract: I will survey some of the recent developments in the
          study of unitary period integrals of automorphic forms on
          GL(n) over a quadratic extension.
          The main tool to study such periods is the relative trace
          formula. I will explain the relevant identity of distributions
          and how it is applied in order to obtain information
          on the automorphic spectrum. In particular, I will explain
          Jacquet's characterization
          of the image of quadratic base change in terms of non
          vanishing of unitary periods and present a joint formula with
          Erez Lapid for the anisotropic unitary period of certain cusp
          forms
          in terms of special values of L-functions. </p>

        <p>Title: Traces of CM values of modular functions and weight
          3/2 modular forms
        </p>
        <p>
          Abstract: The values of the famous j-invariant at quadratic
          irrationalities in the upper half plane are known as singular
          moduli
          and are of particular interest in number theory.
          Zagier realized the generating series of the traces of the
          singular moduli as a classical meromorphic modular form of
          weight 3/2.
          In this talk, we will discuss this and related results and
          give a
          generalization to modular functions on Riemann surfaces of
          arbitrary
          genus. Furthermore, we realize a certain generating series of
          arithmetic
          intersection numbers and Faltings heights as the derivative of
          Zagier's
          Eisenstein series of weight $3/2$. This recovers a result of
          Kudla,
          Rapoport and Yang.

        <p> SPECIAL TALK ON THURSDAY AT 4:30 PM</p>
        <p>Permutation groups and irrationality measures.</p>
        <p>Abstract: In 1996 G. Rhin and C. Viola introduced a new
          algebraic method to obtain qualitative and quantitative
          irrationality results for values of special functions.
          Their method is based upon the study of the structure
          of certain permutation groups arising from the action
          of some birational transformations on double or triple
          Euler-type integrals, combined with the Euler integral
          representation of the hypergeometric function.</p>
