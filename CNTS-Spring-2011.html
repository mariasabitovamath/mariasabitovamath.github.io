                  conjecture.<br>
                  <br>
                  Abstract: Given a p-adic representation V of the
                  Galois group of Q, the Bloch-Kato conjecture predicts
                  a mysterious relationship between two different
                  invariants of V: its Bloch-Kato Selmer group, defined
                  algebraically using Galois cohomology, and its
                  L-function, a complex analytic function defined by a
                  converging Euler product and analytic continuation. In
                  this talk, I will explain this conjecture and discuss
                  in detail its
                  p-adic variant, where the L-function is replaced by a
                  p-adic L
                  -function and the Bloch-Kato Selmer group is suitably
                  modified.
                  I will then explain a strategy to prove the p-adic
                  variant of the Bloch-Kato conjecture for
                  representations V attached to automorphic forms, and
                  the results (on both the variant and the original
                  conjecture) that has been obtained so far with that
                  strategy.

                  <br>
                  Abstract: Let f be a rational function. Silverman
                  proved that if f^2
                  is not a polynomial, then for any x, there are at most
                  finitely many
                  iterates f^n(x) that are integers, i.e. there are at
                  most finitely
                  many iterates f^n(x) that do no meet the point at
                  infinity mod p for
                  any prime p. Using this as a starting point, we
                  discuss a number of
                  questions about orbits of maps (usually rational
                  functions, though we
                  can also say something for endomorphisms of abelian
                  varieties) mod p.
                  In many cases it is possible to say something about
                  the proportion of
                  primes at which some iterate of a point meets another
                  given point
                  (such as the point at infinity) mod p. In others, one
                  can explain the
                  set of primes one gets via the so-called Bang-Zigmondy

                  <br>
                  Abstract: Let f_1 (resp. f_2) denote two (elliptic)
                  newforms of prime level N, trivial character and
                  weight 2 (resp. k+2, where k is either 8 or 12). We
                  provide evidence for the Bloch-Kato conjecture for the
                  motive M=rho_{f_1} x \rho_{f_2}(-k/2-1) by proving
                  that under some assumptions, the p-valuation of the
                  order of the Bloch-Kato Selmer group of M is bounded
                  below by the p-valuation of a special value of the
                  convolution L-function of f_1 and f_2. We achieve this
                  by constructing congruences between the Yoshida lift
                  Y(f_1xf_2)$ of f_1 and f_2 and Siegel modular forms
                  whose p-adic Galois representations are irreducible.
                  Our result is conditional upon the conjectural formula
                  for the Petersson norm of Y(f_1 \otimes f_2). This is

                  <br>
                  Abstract: The theme of the talk is that properties of
                  projective
                  modules over a group ring can be used to study the
                  behavior of certain
                  invariants which occur naturally in Iwasawa theory for
                  an elliptic
                  curve E. Modular representation theory plays a crucial
                  role in this
                  study. It is necessary to make a certain assumption
                  about the
                  vanishing of a $\mu$-invariant. We then study
                  $\lambda$-invariants $\lambda E(\sigma)$, where
                  $\sigma$
                  varies over a family of absolutely irreducible Artin
                  representations.
                  We show that there are non-trivial relationships
                  between these
                  invariants under certain hypotheses.

                  <br>
                  Abstract: Let k be a non-algebraically closed field
                  and X be a surface defined over k. An interesting
                  problem is to know whether the set of k-rational
                  points X(k) is Zariski dense in X. A lot of research
                  is done in this field but, surprisingly, this problem
                  is not completely solved for the simplest class of
                  surfaces, the rational, where one expects a positive
                  answer. In this lecture I will define del Pezzo
                  surfaces, a important subclass of rational surfaces. I
                  will talk about the cases already treated (mainly by
                  Manin), as well as the two cases left open, the del
                  Pezzo surfaces of degrees one and two, presenting
                  recent results (in progress) in the field.

                  Abstract: The classical Shintani lift is the adjoint
                  of the Shimura correspondence. It realizes periods of

                  half-integral modular form. In this talk we revisit
                  the Shintani lift from a (co)homological perspective.
                  In particular, we extend the lift to Eisenstein series
                  and give a geometric interpretation of this extension.
